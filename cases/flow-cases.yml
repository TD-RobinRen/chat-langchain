If no one is available in the group, it will tell the customer the reason "There is no answer at this time, please leave your name and message" and leave a busy message in the â€œagent" ring group for a maximum duration of 300 seconds.
If no one matched in the ring group, ask the customer to choose to leave a voicemail message by pressing 1. Press 2 to set a callback with inbound call number.
