The callback can be made to:\nThe original number.\nAnother phone number (defined previously in the flow).\nAn extension number; this means the caller is going to be called back on the original number + extension number.\nAccording to the flow definition, the Request Callback from Queue component should be added after defining a message informing the callers they can request the callback (this can be done on the waiting message of the A&D or by using a play message, for example).\nWhen the caller hears the message and presses the key for the callback option, they will listen to the message defined in the “Request successful” field of the “Request Callback from Queue” component, and the call is hung up. If the request was unsuccessful (an error occurred during the request), the caller will hear the “Error in request” message and the call is also hung up.\nCallbacks in Studio will also have a priority level associated, which will make a comparison between it and other waiting calls and decide the place in the queue for the request. Call priority outweighs any queue time, i.e., if a call with priority 10 has been in the queue for 30 minutes when a call with priority 1 comes in, the call with priority 1 will be handled first.\nThe agent is presented with a screen pop with the caller's information: name, phone number, callback request time, which queue the caller was waiting in, and which phone number was dialed.\nCustomers will only remain in the waiting queue up to the limit defined in the component. If the time defined to wait for an available agent is reached, and there are no available agents, the call will exit the waiting queue. By default, customers will not receive a message informing them of the timeout, but it can be set at the component level.
